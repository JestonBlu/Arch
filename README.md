#### Arch install guide

This is the best guide I have found to help me through the install process. I dont follow it word for word, but the most important thing to me is getting the bootloader set up correctly which I follow exactly. Ive archived it here `/install_guide` in case the link ever dies. My disk setup is everything on the root partition with a swapfile.
